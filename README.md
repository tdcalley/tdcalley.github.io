#About Me
##My Interests:
I am interested in hiking, camping, mixed martial arts, and military history.
###My interest in hiking and camping has taken me to a number of incredible spots in North Carolina and other states. I am very close to completing all the major peaks in the NC section of the Appalachian Trail, and have hiked the tallest mountains in NC, SC, VA, TN, and GA.
##Recommended Sites:
[The CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook)
###I have been using the CIA World Factbook for assignments since middle school, and in staying up to date with geopolitics and foreign policy this site is a great place to start with understanding any country of interest.
[Flowrestling](https://www.flowrestling.org)
###I started wrestling when I was eight years old, and it took me through college and senior level competition on the All-Marine Corps team. Flowrestling was a starting point for online exposure and the same company now covers several other combat sports.
[AFCEA International](https://www.afcea.org)
###AFCEA is a great organization that provides news in the IT space and excellent opportunities to network and learn within that community with several connections to the DoD.
